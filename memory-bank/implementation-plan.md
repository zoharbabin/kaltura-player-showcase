# Implementation Plan: Rename raptPlayer to interactivePathPlayer

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to rename all instances of "raptPlayer" to "interactivePathPlayer" throughout the codebase, including code, CSS, HTML, and documentation.

## Files to Modify

### 1. index.html
- Line 52: Change `var raptPlayer = PathKalturaPlayer.setup(kconfig);` to `var interactivePathPlayer = PathKalturaPlayer.setup(kconfig);`
- Line 53: Change `raptPlayer.loadMedia({ playlistId: '1_zxnf9ha7' });` to `interactivePathPlayer.loadMedia({ playlistId: '1_zxnf9ha7' });`
- Line 55: Change `Use <code>raptPlayer.addListener(...)</code>` to `Use <code>interactivePathPlayer.addListener(...)</code>`

### 2. JavaScript Files
No direct instances of "raptPlayer" were found in the JavaScript files, but we should verify that there are no references in other files that weren't checked.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update index.html to replace all instances of "raptPlayer" with "interactivePathPlayer"
2. Verify that the changes don't break any functionality
3. Update the Memory Bank files to reflect the changes

## Verification

After making the changes, we should verify that:
1. The application still functions correctly
2. All references to the player are consistent
3. No instances of "raptPlayer" remain in the codebase
