## Implementation Note

Since Architect mode can only edit Markdown files, you'll need to switch to Code mode to actually create the `.gitignore` file with this content.

### Recommendation

Use the following command to switch to Code mode:

```
switch_mode code "Create .gitignore file"
```

Once in Code mode, you can create the `.gitignore` file with the content provided above.
