# Active Context

## Current Focus
Refactoring the Kaltura Player reference implementation and improving its UX.

Completed task: Renamed "raptPlayer" to "interactivePathPlayer" throughout the codebase for better clarity and consistency.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: The current single-file implementation containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `js/main.js`: Main application module handling player initialization and mode switching.
- `js/player/player.js`: Base player module with common functionality.
- `js/player/interactive.js`: Interactive player implementation using RAPT API.
- `js/player/regular.js`: Regular player implementation using standard Kaltura Player API.
- `js/controls/controls.js`: Controls module for player controls.

## Current State
The application is a reference implementation for the Kaltura video player with two modes:
1. **Interactive Mode**: Uses the RAPT API for interactive video experiences
2. **Regular Mode**: Uses the standard Kaltura Player API for regular video playback

The UI includes controls for:
- Play/Pause
- Mode switching
- Seeking
- Volume control
- Playback speed
- Timeline markers and chapters (in Regular mode only)

Recent bug fixes:
- Fixed issue with mode switching causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')" error in visibility.js
- Fixed issue with "Button state updated: paused" being called continuously by adding state tracking in the updatePlayButton method
- Fixed issue with switching from interactive to regular video mode failing by unifying the player creation approach and improving cleanup

## User Requirements
1. Improve the UX for the player controls
2. Refactor the large HTML file into separate files
3. Follow latest best practices
4. Ensure clarity, maintainability, and code efficiency
