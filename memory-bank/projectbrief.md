# Kaltura Player Reference Implementation - Project Brief

## Overview
This project involves refactoring a Kaltura video player reference implementation and improving its user experience. The current implementation is a single HTML file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, which needs to be split into separate files for better maintainability and extensibility.

## Current Implementation
- Single HTML file (`index.html`) containing all code
- Two player modes: Interactive and Regular
- Basic controls for playback, seeking, volume, speed, and timeline markers
- Simple horizontal layout for controls
- Functional but basic UI

## Requirements
1. Improve the UX for the player controls
2. Refactor the large HTML file into separate files
3. Follow latest best practices for web development
4. Ensure clarity, maintainability, and code efficiency
5. Create reusable components where appropriate

## Constraints
- Must maintain all existing functionality
- Must support both Interactive and Regular modes
- Must maintain compatibility with Kaltura Player API
