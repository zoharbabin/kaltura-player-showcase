# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Initial code review and analysis
- Project brief documentation
- Architecture planning
- System patterns documentation
- Technical context documentation
- Fixed mode switching issue causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')" error
- Renamed "raptPlayer" to "interactivePathPlayer" throughout the codebase for better clarity and consistency

## Current Status
Planning phase completed. Implementation in progress.

## Next Steps

### 1. Create File Structure
- Create directory structure for CSS and JavaScript files
- Set up initial files based on the architecture plan

### 2. Refactor HTML
- Extract HTML structure from the current implementation
- Organize HTML into a more semantic structure
- Link to external CSS and JavaScript files

### 3. Refactor CSS
- Extract CSS from the current implementation
- Organize CSS into separate files based on functionality
- Improve styling for better UX
- Implement responsive design

### 4. Refactor JavaScript
- Extract JavaScript from the current implementation
- Organize JavaScript into modules based on functionality
- Implement the module pattern for better code organization
- Improve event handling and state management

### 5. Improve UX for Controls
- Redesign controls for better usability
- Group related controls
- Add visual feedback for active states
- Improve layout and responsiveness

### 6. Testing
- Test all functionality in both Interactive and Regular modes
- Ensure compatibility with Kaltura Player API
- Verify that all requirements are met

### 7. Documentation
- Update documentation with implementation details
- Document any changes to the architecture or design
- Provide usage instructions

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue with mode switching causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')" error in visibility.js
  - Improved player container cleanup in the `ensurePlayerContainer()` method
  - Added DOM ready check function `ensureDomReady()`
  - Enhanced the mode initialization sequence in the `initializeMode()` method
  - Improved the player destruction in the `destroyCurrentPlayer()` method
  - Added specific handling for the visibility.js error by creating a missing dismissible container
  - Added a timeout for the player ready event to prevent hanging

- Fixed issue with "Button state updated: paused" being called continuously
  - Modified the `updatePlayButton()` method in `controls.js` to track state changes
  - Added a comparison between previous and current state
  - Now it only logs when the button state actually changes, not on every update interval

- Fixed issue with switching from interactive to regular video mode failing
  - Simplified the player creation process in `main.js` to use the same `createPlayer` function for both modes
  - Enhanced the `initialize()` method in `regular.js` with proper cleanup of existing Kaltura Player instances
  - Added thorough container cleanup and error handling
  - Made the mode switching process properly async with proper error handling
  - Added additional checks and delays to ensure proper DOM cleanup between mode switches
