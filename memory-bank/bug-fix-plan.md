# Bug Fix Plan: Completed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mode Switching Issue
Fixed the issue with mode switching causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelector')" error in visibility.js.

### 2. Continuous Button State Logging
Fixed the issue with "Button state updated: paused" being called continuously by adding state tracking in the updatePlayButton method.

### 3. Mode Switching Failure
Fixed the issue with switching from interactive to regular video mode failing by unifying the player creation approach and improving cleanup.

## Implementation Details

All issues have been successfully fixed and documented. For detailed information about the bug fixes, including root cause analysis and implementation details, please refer to the [Bug Fix Documentation](./bug-fix-documentation.md).

## Current Status

All identified bugs have been fixed and the player now functions correctly:
- Mode switching works seamlessly between interactive and regular modes
- Button state logging only occurs when the state actually changes
- Player cleanup and initialization is properly handled during mode switches

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a more robust state management system to track player state changes
- Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases in mode switching
- Consider adding unit tests for the player initialization and mode switching functionality
