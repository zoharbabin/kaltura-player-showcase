# UX Improvements Plan

## Current UX Issues
1. Controls are arranged in a simple horizontal layout that becomes cluttered
2. Minimal visual hierarchy and grouping of related controls
3. Basic styling with limited visual feedback
4. Seek functionality requires manual input of seconds
5. Timeline marker controls are not intuitive
6. Limited responsiveness for different screen sizes

## UX Improvement Goals
1. Create a more intuitive and visually appealing control interface
2. Group related controls for better usability
3. Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions
4. Improve the seeking experience
5. Make timeline controls more intuitive
6. Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes

## Design Approach

### Layout and Organization
1. **Group Related Controls**
   - Playback controls (play/pause)
   - Transport controls (seek, timeline)
   - Volume controls
   - Playback settings (speed)
   - Timeline markers (in Regular mode)

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Primary controls (play/pause, seek) more prominent
   - Secondary controls (volume, speed) less prominent
   - Mode-specific controls clearly separated

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Controls adapt to different screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly touch targets
   - Collapsible sections for smaller screens

### Visual Design Improvements

1. **Control Styling**
   - Modern, flat design with subtle shadows
   - Consistent color scheme aligned with Kaltura branding
   - Clear iconography for common actions
   - Hover and active states for better feedback

2. **Seek Bar Improvements**
   - Visual timeline with preview thumbnails
   - Click-to-seek functionality
   - Current position indicator
   - Markers visible on the timeline

3. **Volume Control**
   - Vertical slider on hover (desktop)
   - Mute/unmute toggle
   - Visual volume level indicator

### Interaction Improvements

1. **Seek Functionality**
   - Click on timeline to seek
   - Drag position indicator
   - Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys)
   - Time display (current/total)

2. **Timeline Markers**
   - Visual indicators on the timeline
   - Click to jump to marker
   - Add/remove individual markers
   - Marker preview on hover

3. **Mode Switching**
   - Clear indication of current mode
   - Smooth transition between modes
   - Disable unavailable features based on mode

## Accessibility Considerations
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for all controls
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus indicators
- Screen reader support
